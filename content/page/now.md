This is my [**Now Page**](https://nownownow.com/about), inspired by Derek Siver's idea to make a web version of the good old [finger protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol). It's an informal way of showing what I'm up to these days.

I'm home in Madrid, Spain. Currently working for the [Kurento](https://github.com/Kurento) project, completing my daily exercising goals, and planning a trip that will bring me through Turkey and end up in a wedding at Baku, Azerbaijan.

Slowly getting into a vegetarian diet. Also, spring arrived with some incredible sunny days, so time to go out for a walk!

Currently reading:
