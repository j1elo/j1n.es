# What I'm doing now

(This is [a Now Page](https://nownownow.com/about), inspired by Derek Siver's idea to make a web version of the good old [finger protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol) and *.plan* files)

I'm home in Madrid, Spain. It's winter.

Current reading list:

- [Fooled by Randomness](https://books.google.es/books?id=DCqFYOrGyegC): *The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets*, by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
- [Programming Rust](https://books.google.es/books?id=hcc_DwAAQBAJ): *Fast, Safe Systems Development* (O'Reilly), by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff.
